the world is dangerous and everyone needs help + support from others all the time.

some people are willing and able to help strangers. betrayers imitate this group to exploit desperate strangers
some people are in desperate need of help. betrayers imitate this group to exploit kind strangers
all rolls must be made by at least two people working together.

each person contributes a small bonus or perk according to the approach/style they use to attack the problem
these approaches are written in secret before the roll is made, then revealed at once. (The characters can lie to each other.)

one approach is Betrayal. approaching a roll with Betrayal allows the betrayer to turn the result of the roll in their favor- if the effort succeeds
if multiple characters approach with Betrayal, the roll automatically fails.
 
characters can attempt rolls on their own, but they must expend a special and precious resource/suffer dire consequences,

some ideas for approaches:
guile, passion, deftness, empathy, cunning, force, wildness
